Message Text: A Journey of #OpportunitiesCorner. How it started? 

Sitting with a cousin at his Home in a Garden with a Glass of Juice. He gave me an Idea why Not to Start Career Counceling or Scholarship Blog? Because you have alot of Experience and You went on Many Exchange Programs.

And now here I am with my Baby Opportunites Corner. It was a journey of experiences, difficulties, exposure and finding my self.
